# About

Welcome to my first attempt at a Natural Language Processing competition on Kaggle!<br><br>

Thanks to smartphones and easy access to Internet everywhere, people are able to announce an emergency they're observing in real-time and that can be very useful to help people to avoid certain areas, to alert authorities, disaster relief organizations and news agencies. However, although a human could quite easily distinguish between a tweet that is about a real emergency and one that uses certain emergency-related words in a metaphorical way, it isn't quite the same when it comes to machines.<br><br>

The goal of this competition is to train a machine learning model that will learn how to differentiate between a tweet about a real disaster and one that isn't.<br><br>

To help me with that goal, I'm going to use PyCaret which is an AutoML library for Python and the reason I'm doing so is that whenever I'm learning something new about machine learning, I always like to use AutoML tools to help me observe how these models can actually work in practice!<br><br>

The dataset I'm using for this work is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started">Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets</a>, which is one of the "getting started" competetions on Kaggle.<br><br>

# What is Natural Language Processing?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a branch of artificial intelligence that's focused on analyzing and understanding the languages that humans use naturally in order to interface with computers in written and spoken contexts.<br><br>

Nowadays, NLP in machine learning is used for sentiment analysis, which helps the machine to identify the mood or opinions within large amounts of text, document summarization, transforming voice commands into written text, and also automatic translation.<br><br>
